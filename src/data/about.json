Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. We'll have a super time. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. You can spend all day playing with mountains. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you.",
