        "Hi! I'm Jeremy Lo. I'm a front end software developer that specializes in JS, CSS, Python, and recently TypeScript. I also have a secondary interest in automation via Jenkins and Python.",
        "Currently, I work at Electronic Arts, but my previous experience includes Tantalus Systems and BlackBerry. I help our FIFA Companion App designers take their features through every stage, from researching estimates to practical implementation. Because the app regularly pushes updates on Android, iOS, and web, I mantain my team's relationship with the live services group and participate in collaborative bug fixing.",
        "I am driven to solve problems by improving code maintainability and eliminating tech debt. My ideal work environment is one where I can challenge myself to constantly improve. Right now, I am currently diving into TypeScript.",
        "So if you need something built, I build things. Like this site, which I built with React and a bit of free time. Thanks for visiting!"
