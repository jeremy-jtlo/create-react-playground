## ReactJS Playground Result: a Refactored Resume

A resume and personal website created with a few hacked-together ReactJS components. Data is pulled from JSON to populate each tag, separating content from the view without using a backend framework.

## How to Run it

This project was built using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). Definitely took a lot of the confusion out of setting up a new project, and deploying a dev build couldn't be easier.

* `npm start` will start the dev server and open this page in your default browser.

## Why, though?

Trying to maintain a website using raw HTML gets more difficult as each page grows in content and complexity. Learning to use and deploy a CMS takes time, and such a tool can be too resource-intensive for a simple online resume like this. By keeping the content in JSON files away from the view, future changes to both sides becomes easier and less prone to error.
